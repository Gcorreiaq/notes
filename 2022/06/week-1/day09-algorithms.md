- **Doubly-Linked Lists**: Have three elements, the data pointer, the next element pointer and the previous element pointer. If you want to set the head and the tail of the list, set the previous pointer in thefirst element to NULL and the next pointer in the last element to NULL. \
\
A doubly-linked list offers more flexibility than singly-linked lists in moving about the list. Useful when we know where an element might be stored in the list. \
\
Inserting an element in a doubly-linked list is similar to inserting one in a singly-linked list. The primary difference is that in addition to managing the next pointers, we must manage the prev pointers to keep the list linked properly in the reverse direction.
