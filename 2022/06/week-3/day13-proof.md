- **Conjectures, Proofs and disproofs**: A conjecture is a statement that has been proposed to be a true. If, and when, a conjecture is proved true, it becomes a theorem. A conjecture may be disproved by producing a counterexample.\
\
Since 2^2 − 1 = 4 − 1 = 3 is a prime, since 2^3 − 1 = 8 − 1 = 7 is a prime, since 2^5 − 1 = 32−1 = 31 is a prime, and since 2^7 − 1 = 128−1 = 127 is a prime, we might make the conjecture that “For p a prime, 2^p −1 is a prime.” To disprove this statement, we must present a single counterexample. In this case, we note that p = 11 is a prime and compute 2^11 − 1 = 2048 − 1 = 2047 = (23)(89), which shows that 2^11 − 1 is a composite. Thus, we have disproved the stated conjecture. However, by disproving the conjecture, we have also proven the theorem “There is a prime p such that 2^p − 1 is not a prime.” We now present several well-known conjectures. 

- **Fermat's Theorem**: Fermat is best known as the father of Number Theory and one of the founders of Analytic Geometry, Calculus, and Probability. \

Fermat's Theorem: For _n_ a natural number greater than 2, the equation a^n + b^n = c^n has no natural number solutions _a b c_.
