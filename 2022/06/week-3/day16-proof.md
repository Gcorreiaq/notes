- **The system of Rational Numbers and the System of Real Numbers**: The set of integers is not closed under the operation of division, since for all integers m and n the equation mx = n does not always have an integer solution x. Clearly, the equation 3x = 4 does not have an integer solution.  We wish to enlarge the set of integers to obtain a new set of numbers in such a way that if m and n are in the new set, then the solution x of the equation mx = n is always in the new set and the new set is closed under addition, multiplication, and subtraction as well. \
\
The set of rational numbers are represented as follows: \
    Q = { n/m | n, m ∈ Z and m 6= 0}. \
\
The rational numbers 1/2, 2/4 etc are all different representations for the same rational number, which satisfies the equation 2 * x = 1. The rational numbers n/m and p/q are equal if and only if n * q = m * p. \
\
Every integer can be represented as a rational number. By associating the integer n with the rational number n/1, we see that the set of integers is contained in the set of rational numbers. \
\
**The cancellation law** follows easily from the commutative and associative properties of multiplication for integers and from the definition of equality for rational numbers, since: \
    (n · p) · m = m · (n · p) = m · (p · n) = (m · p) · n\
\
In practice, we write: \
    n * p / m * p = n / m
