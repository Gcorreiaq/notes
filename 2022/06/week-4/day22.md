- **Circular Lists**: A circular list can be singly-linked or doubly-linked, but its distinguishing feature is that it has no tail. In a circular list, the next pointer of the last element points back to its first element rather than NULL. In the case of doubly-linked lists, the prev pointer points to the last element as well. \
\
In practice, whether to make use of a singly-linked list circular list or one that is doubly-linked depends on the same reasoning presented earlier for choosing between singly-linked and doubly-linked lists that are not circular.
